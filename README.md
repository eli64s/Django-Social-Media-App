# Django-Social-Media-App
A social media web-application built with Django (work in progress). The primary purpose of this application was to deepen my understanding in how user-based applications work in areas like registration, account login and logout, adding and removing friends, and much more.

I will update the README.md file as this project progresses, but in the mean time I attached a photo of the app's homepage. As you can see, the user has the ability to post a status in their feed, add other users, and view their friends list.

Additionally, you may notice the main folder is named **gym_project**. The ultimate goal of this project would be creating a social platform for finding workout buddies!https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eli64s/Django-Social-Media-App/master/social_app_home.PNG
