# Django-Social-Media-App
A social media web-application built with Django (work in progress). The primary purpose of this application was to further my understanding of the functionality of user registration, account login/logout, along with friending and interacting with other users.

You will see that the main folder is named **gym_project**. My end goal of this project is to create a social platform for finding workout buddies!
