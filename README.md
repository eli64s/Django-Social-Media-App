# Django-Social-Media-App
I am developing a social media web-application with Django to deepen my understanding in the functionality of user-based applications in areas like registration, account login/logout, adding/removing friends, middleware, and much more.

I will update the README.md file as this project progresses, but in the mean time I attached a photo of the app's homepage. As you can see, the user can post a status to their timeline, add and remove users, and view their friends list.

Additionally, you may notice the main folder is named **gym_project**. The ultimate goal of this project would be creating a social platform for finding workout buddies!https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eli64s/Django-Social-Media-App/master/social_app_home.PNG
