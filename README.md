# Django-Social-Media-App
A social media web-application built with Django (work in progress). The primary purpose of this application was to deepen my understanding in how user-based applications work in areas like registration, account login and logout, adding and removing friends, and much more.

You will see that the main folder is named **gym_project**. My end goal of this project is to create a social platform for finding workout buddies!
